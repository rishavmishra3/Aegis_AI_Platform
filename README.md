# Aegis AI: The Real-Time Crowd Intelligence Platform

## 1. Executive Summary

**Aegis AI** is a next-generation public safety platform designed to mitigate risks in large-scale public gatherings. Leveraging state-of-the-art computer vision and a scalable microservices architecture, Aegis AI proactively identifies precursor behaviors to dangerous events like stampedes, aggression, and medical emergencies. Our platform transforms standard CCTV feeds into an active, intelligent network, providing security operators with the critical seconds needed to prevent disaster. This demonstration showcases the core AI capabilities and the production-ready architecture designed for deployment in Dubai's most iconic venues.

## 2. The Problem

Large gatherings in malls, metros, stadiums, and event venues are vulnerable to rapid escalation of public safety incidents. Traditional human-only monitoring is reactive and struggles to detect subtle, early warning signs across vast areas. A single fight, a medical emergency, or a localized panic can cascade into a catastrophic stampede within minutes.

## 3. The Aegis AI Solution

Aegis AI provides a proactive layer of intelligence by analyzing crowd behavior at three levels:

*   **Individual Analysis (Pose Estimation):** We don't just see a person; we understand their posture. This allows us to instantly detect **falls**, a primary indicator of a medical issue or the start of a crush. We can also flag aggressive postures.
*   **Group Dynamics (Proximity & Velocity Analysis):** The system identifies groups of people moving at unusually high speeds, indicating localized panic or conflict. It flags individuals moving against the dominant crowd flow.
*   **Macroscopic Anomaly Detection:** By analyzing the collective motion and density, our AI establishes a "normalcy baseline" and flags any statistically significant deviation, catching unpredictable "black swan" events.

## 4. Technology Stack & Architecture

Aegis AI is built on a robust, scalable microservices architecture, demonstrating our readiness for enterprise-level deployment.

*   **Containerization:** `Docker` & `Docker Compose` for consistent, isolated, and scalable service deployment.
*   **AI Inference:** `YOLOv8-Pose` model optimized with `ONNX Runtime` for high-performance human pose estimation.
*   **Data Backbone:** `Redis Streams` for a high-throughput, low-latency message bus between services.
*   **Operational Dashboard:** `Streamlit` for a responsive, real-time web interface.
*   **Language:** `Python 3.10+`

## 5. How to Run the Demonstration

**Prerequisites:**
*   [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running.
*   A GPU with NVIDIA drivers is recommended for best performance.

**Step 1: Export the Optimized AI Model**

The YOLOv8-Pose model needs to be converted to the high-performance ONNX format. Open your terminal and run this one-time command:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v .:/usr/src/ultralytics ultralytics/ultralytics yolo export model=yolov8n-pose.pt format=onnx half=True
```
*This command uses the official YOLO Docker image to perform the export. It will create `models/yolov8n-pose.onnx`.*

**Step 2: Launch the Platform**

With Docker running, launch the entire platform using a single command from the project's root directory:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
*This will build the container images for the analyzer and the dashboard, then start all services.*

**Step 3: View the Dashboard**

Once the services are running (you'll see logs in your terminal), open your web browser and navigate to:

**http://localhost:8501**

You will see the Aegis AI dashboard in action, analyzing the test video and providing real-time analytics and alerts.
